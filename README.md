## Bugs list:

* With 3 employees and 3 tables the schedule list starts with the same table;
* The *rest slot* logic isn't working fine, so it was removed temporarily;
* The `Buttons` in the `Employees` and `Tables pages` could not be rightly positioned;

## Improvement list:

* Login/OAuth screen to allow only users with permissions access the system and the features;
* When use the real API, set the [Loader](https://mantine.dev/core/loader/) to these cases;
* Set a new page to manage the Users after the Login task became done;
* Make the shift table horizontal scrolling.
